Given a linked list, determine if it exhibits a continuous mountain and valley pattern.

A continuous mountain and valley pattern is characterized by a sequence of nodes where the values consistently alternate between increasing and decreasing.

Note: if only one node, then return 1.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer 'n' representing the number of nodes in the linked list.

The second line contains 'n' space-separated integers representing the values of the nodes in the linked list.

Output Format
'1' indicates that the linked list follows a continuous mountain and valley pattern.

'0' indicates the linked list does not follow the continuous mountain and valley pattern.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 4 *10^3
0 <=elements of linked list  <= 10^4

Sample Testcase 0
Testcase Input
5
1 2 3 2 1
Testcase Output
0
Explanation
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
As 1 to 3 is increasing, that means values consistently do not alternate between increasing and decreasing. So the answer is 0.
Sample Testcase 1
Testcase Input
5
1 2 1 2 1
Testcase Output
1
Explanation
1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1
As values consistently alternate between increasing and decreasing. So the answer is 1
